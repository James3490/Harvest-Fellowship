       <h1 align="center">Faith: "The Link That Connects Man to God"</h1>

       <p align=center>Are your Finances withered? The Scriptures declare that We are to submit ourselves to God, resist the Devil and he will flee from you. Submit would encompass prayer, fasting, cleansing, and obedience to His Word.â€‹ Satan is the devourer of your finances and God said He would rebuke the devourer. Want a more profitable financial future? Study and practice Malachi 3:9-11. My formula is 10-10 and 10. Pay 10% tithes, 10% in the offering, then 10% to yourself; that's right, pay yourself at least 10% of what is left after the tithes and offering. It really works, but very few will try it. God said, prove me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour ye out a blessing........</p>

          <h3 align="center">Heb 11:6</h3>

         <p align="center">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. KJV</p>

      <p align=center>Do you believe that Jesus had a vision, perhaps a vision of His church?  Well, I do.  I believe that Jesus' vision was captured in the 16th chapter of Mark in the 17th and 18th verse. "  In My name, they shall.......".  Take a look at the entire verse and you'll see that Jesus never said one time that He or the Father would do any of those things, but that "they", "them", would do the works.  To do such works takes faith, and faith as a grain of mustard seed.  I do not mean the size of our faith, but the surety of our faith.  A mustard seed planted will always come up mustard.  It will never come up anything except mustard.  So when we plant the seed of faith we must have our mind made up and not let circumstances change it. Keep praying (watering), keep knocking and the door will open.  Jesus' vision is my vision and if you think about it, it's yours also. Now let us have dreams about that vision and that will cause our faith to gather strength.</p>

      <h3 align=center>3 John 2</h3>

         <p align=center>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
            KJV</p>
         <p align=center>Faith is not measured by size or capacity, but by strength. Knowing the Word of God will strengthen your faith in your heart; so feed your faith by committing His Word to your heart.</p>

         <h3 align=center>Zeph 3:16</h3>

            <p align=center>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.
            KJV</p>
            
            <p align=center>Faith eliminates fear and produces Hope. Hope produces Faith. Faith eliminates Fear.</p>

               <h3 align=center>Matt 17:20</h3>

               <p align=center>If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you. KJV</p>
               <p align=center>Faith is not measured in capacity, how big or how small but in how sure. The smallest of all seeds know what it is and what it will produce when it is finished. Faith is in knowing the finish.</p>

               <h3 align=center>Heb 10:38</h3>

               <p align=center>Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</p>
                  
               <p align=center>Faith is the tool that gives us God Grace.</p>

                  <h3 align=center>Romans 12:3</h3>
                  <p align=center>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
                  KJV</p>
                  <p align=center>No one can say they do not have faith. We exhibit faith in humans, machinery, and the services they render us but constantly doubt God, even though His Word says; Heb 11:6. But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>

            <h3 align=center>Matt 17:20</h3>

            <p align=center>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, Matt 17:20-21
            Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
            Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. KJV</p>
            
            <p align=center>When you plant a seed the seed will always come up what it is, whether it be mustard or rice, beans or whatever- you cannot make it produce anything different. Mustard will produce mustard no matter what! This is the kind of faith our prayers should have, "nothing can change our mind." It's not how big or how small our faith is, but how sure it is. We must have a made up mind, a mind that nothing can sway from our prayer.</p>
